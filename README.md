# multiclass-segmentation

-This project is about semantic segmentation(multiclass) on Camvid(Cambridge Videos) dataset. PSP-net (pyramid scene parsing network) and U-net with Resnet-Residual network encoder are implemented in this project. Resnet50 and Resnet101 are used as feature extracter to achieve the feature map 

-PSP-net is highly recommended for high resolution segmentation (large input image)

-This project was done totally on google colab so that i choose the input image size is 480x480 (smaller size will not give a good result)

-This project was made based on the original paper of pyramid scene parsing network: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01105

-The training dataset was downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/carlolepelaars/camvid and the test video was download from: http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/
